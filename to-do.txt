# PROJECT TO-DO & SESSION TRACKER

## HOW TO USE THIS FILE

This file tracks progress across development sessions and serves as project memory.

### DURING A SESSION:
1. Create a new "SESSION X" section with date at the start of each session
2. Add goals as they emerge, mark them [X] when completed
3. Track steps in real-time, marking each [DONE] as you complete it
4. Add NOTES, DEBUGGING, or other subsections as needed during work
5. If session has multiple phases, you can use subsections, but consolidate at the end

### AT END OF SESSION:
1. Consolidate all session entries into ONE clean section (remove fragmented entries)
2. Organize accomplishments by logical categories (Foundation, Design, Features, etc.)
3. Include these sections in final summary:
   - **GOALS COMPLETED** - High-level objectives achieved
   - **KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS** - Detailed breakdown by category
   - **FILES CREATED** - List of new files/components
   - **TECHNICAL NOTES** - Important decisions, patterns, gotchas
   - **SESSION SUMMARY** - What was accomplished, current state, next priorities

### FORMAT EXAMPLE:

```

### TECHNICAL NOTES
- Particles.js using CDN instead of npm packages for reliability

- [X] Build education section with spotlight reveal effect
- [X] Create vertical timeline with alternating layout

### KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS

**Projects Section:**
- Created TypeScript interface for Project with filterable attributes (tags, category, date, status, progress, featured)
- Built responsive grid layout using CSS Grid (auto-fill, minmax 350px)
- Designed vertical project cards with fixed 250px image height

  - Dark overlay (75% opacity) with brightness boost layer in revealed area
  - Radial gradient mask follows mouse movement
- Added multi-layered neon border effects on hover
  - Virginia Tech: Orange glow (#ff8c42)
  - Boston University: Red glow (#ff0040)
- Implemented scale animation (1.05x) on image hover
- Added school logos that fade in on hover
  - VT logo: bottom-right corner

### FILES CREATED
```

  types/project.ts
  data/projects.ts
  components/ProjectCard.astro
```

### FILES MODIFIED
```
src/components/sections/
  ProjectsSection.astro
  EducationSection.astro
  TimelineSection.astro
```

### TECHNICAL NOTES
- Spotlight effect uses CSS mask-image with radial-gradient for cursor tracking
- Multiple spotlight instances handled with querySelectorAll and forEach loop
- Project cards use cursor-following effect via mousemove event listeners
- CSS Grid order property used to flip layout without changing HTML structure
- Progress bar displays "Completed" text for 100% projects, percentage otherwise
- Drop-shadow filters used for neon glow effects (better than box-shadow for complex shapes)
- Timeline uses calculated margins (calc(2% + 8px)) to maintain alignment at different screen sizes
- All hover effects use cubic-bezier easing for smooth, bouncy animations

### SESSION 2 SUMMARY

**What was accomplished:**
- Complete Projects section with interactive grid, hover effects, and progress tracking
- Fully functional Education section featuring spotlight reveal effect and neon borders
- Timeline mockup with vertical layout and alternating boxes
- 9 mock projects with varied attributes for testing filtering/sorting
- Dual education entries (Virginia Tech Master's, Boston University Bachelor's)
- 6 timeline events showcasing the journey structure

**Current state:**
- Projects page ready for real project data
- Education section with interactive spotlight and school-specific branding
- Timeline structure complete, ready for actual journey milestones
- All three sections have polished hover interactions and animations
- Consistent dark theme across all new sections

**Next priorities:**
- Populate sections with real content (actual projects, timeline events)
- Build out Home section with introduction
- Create Reach Out/Contact section
- Add filtering/sorting functionality to projects grid
