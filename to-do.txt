# PROJECT TO-DO & SESSION TRACKER

## HOW TO USE THIS FILE

This file tracks progress across development sessions and serves as project memory.

### DURING A SESSION:
1. Create a new "SESSION X" section with date at the start of each session
2. Add goals as they emerge, mark them [X] when completed
3. Track steps in real-time, marking each [DONE] as you complete it
4. Add NOTES, DEBUGGING, or other subsections as needed during work
5. If session has multiple phases, you can use subsections, but consolidate at the end

### AT END OF SESSION:
1. Consolidate all session entries into ONE clean section (remove fragmented entries)
2. Organize accomplishments by logical categories (Foundation, Design, Features, etc.)
3. Include these sections in final summary:
   - **GOALS COMPLETED** - High-level objectives achieved
   - **KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS** - Detailed breakdown by category
   - **FILES CREATED** - List of new files/components
   - **TECHNICAL NOTES** - Important decisions, patterns, gotchas
   - **SESSION SUMMARY** - What was accomplished, current state, next priorities

### FORMAT EXAMPLE:

- PixelCanvas uses Web Components API with Shadow DOM for encapsulation
- Custom element registration with customElements.define()
- Canvas animation uses requestAnimationFrame with 60fps throttling

**Session 3 Work in Progress:**
- Navigation redesign:
  * Split Portfolio logo (fixed top-left) from nav links

  * Each nav link has pill-shaped background that appears when section is active
- Logo implementation:
  * Replaced "Portfolio" text with custom logo image (rdy_logo_white.png)
  * Logo sized to 1rem height for compact display
  * Hover effect changes opacity instead of color
  * Logo remains clickable and navigates to home section
  * Nav styling adjusted for single-line display (reduced gaps, padding, font size)
- Home section redesign:
  * Two-column layout (CSS Grid, 1.6fr 1fr - wider left column for long phrases)
  * Layout positioned higher on page (margin-top: -8rem)
  * Left column: Dynamic typing animation
    - Text: "Hello, my name is Rudy, and I'm [a/an] [rotating title]"
    - 7 rotating titles: Integration Engineer, Full-Stack Developer, AI Systems Architect, Project Lead, Computer Scientist, Problem Solver, The Best Candidate
    - Dynamic article selection: automatically switches between "a", "an", or no article
      - Vowel detection for "a" vs "an"
      - Removes article completely for phrases starting with "The"

  * Font sizes: 3rem (desktop) → 2.5rem (tablet) → 2rem (mobile)
  * Max width: 1400px with 2rem padding
- Projects section styling:
  * Added 4rem top margin for spacing from home section
  * Applied dark gray background (#0a0a0a) to distinguish from black home section
  * Added skills section between title and project cards:
    - "SKILLS" text written vertically (upright orientation, 1.5rem font, bold)
    - Title spans full height of divider with centered alignment
    - Vertical divider (1px, full height, #333 color)
    - Skills organized into 3 categories: Languages, Frameworks & Libraries, Technologies & Tools
    - 26 total skills across all categories
    - Each skill has a colored circular icon (8px) using official brand colors
    - White rounded tags (8px border-radius) with dark text
    - Category titles in uppercase gray with letter spacing
    - Smooth hover effect: purple background (rgb(153, 82, 228)) with white text
  * Optimized project cards layout for better aspect ratio:
    - Fixed 3-column grid layout (repeat(3, 1fr))
    - Reduced image height from 200px to 180px
    - Reduced content padding from 1.5rem to 1.25rem

  * Responsive design: 3 columns → 2 columns (tablet) → 1 column (mobile)
  * Interactive skill-based filtering system:
    - Skill tags are clickable buttons with proper cursor and accessibility
    - Multi-select filtering: multiple skills can be active simultaneously
    - Projects shown only if they match ALL of the selected skills (AND logic)
    - Non-matching projects get 30% opacity + 100% grayscale filter
    - Filtered projects reordered using CSS order property (matching: order 0, non-matching: order 1)
    - Active skill tags highlighted in purple background
    - Click skill again to deselect (toggle behavior)
    - Unselecting a skill updates filter to show projects with remaining selected skills
    - "Clear Filter" button appears when any filter is active, clears all selections
    - Smooth 0.5s transitions on all filter effects
    - Projects wrapped in data-tags attribute for filtering logic
    - Uses Set data structure to track active skills
