# PROJECT TO-DO & SESSION TRACKER

## HOW TO USE THIS FILE

This file tracks progress across development sessions and serves as project memory.

### DURING A SESSION:
1. Create a new "SESSION X" section with date at the start of each session
2. Add goals as they emerge, mark them [X] when completed
3. Track steps in real-time, marking each [DONE] as you complete it
4. Add NOTES, DEBUGGING, or other subsections as needed during work
5. If session has multiple phases, you can use subsections, but consolidate at the end

### AT END OF SESSION:
1. Consolidate all session entries into ONE clean section (remove fragmented entries)
2. Organize accomplishments by logical categories (Foundation, Design, Features, etc.)
3. Include these sections in final summary:
   - **GOALS COMPLETED** - High-level objectives achieved
   - **KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS** - Detailed breakdown by category
   - **FILES CREATED** - List of new files/components
   - **TECHNICAL NOTES** - Important decisions, patterns, gotchas
   - **SESSION SUMMARY** - What was accomplished, current state, next priorities

  * Smart article selection: automatically types "a", "an", or no article based on context
  * Vowel detection for "a" vs "an" logic
  * Removes article completely for phrases starting with "The"
  * Article types out character-by-character (in white) before the word

  * Smooth purple hover effect (rgb(153, 82, 228)) with white text
- Interactive skill-based filtering system:
  * Multi-select filtering: multiple skills can be active simultaneously
  * AND logic: projects shown only if they match ALL selected skills
  * Visual feedback: non-matching projects get 30% opacity + 100% grayscale filter
  * CSS order property reorders filtered projects (matching: order 0, non-matching: order 1)
  * Active skill tags highlighted in purple background
