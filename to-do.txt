# PROJECT TO-DO & SESSION TRACKER

## HOW TO USE THIS FILE

This file tracks progress across development sessions and serves as project memory.

### DURING A SESSION:
1. Create a new "SESSION X" section with date at the start of each session
2. Add goals as they emerge, mark them [X] when completed
3. Track steps in real-time, marking each [DONE] as you complete it
4. Add NOTES, DEBUGGING, or other subsections as needed during work
5. If session has multiple phases, you can use subsections, but consolidate at the end

### AT END OF SESSION:
1. Consolidate all session entries into ONE clean section (remove fragmented entries)
2. Organize accomplishments by logical categories (Foundation, Design, Features, etc.)
3. Include these sections in final summary:
   - **GOALS COMPLETED** - High-level objectives achieved
   - **KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS** - Detailed breakdown by category
   - **FILES CREATED** - List of new files/components
   - **TECHNICAL NOTES** - Important decisions, patterns, gotchas
   - **SESSION SUMMARY** - What was accomplished, current state, next priorities

### KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS

**Navigation System:**

  * Smart article selection: automatically types "a", "an", or no article based on context
  * Vowel detection for "a" vs "an" logic
  * Removes article completely for phrases starting with "The"
  * Article types out character-by-character (in white) before the word
  * Smooth animation sequence: types article → 100ms pause → types word → 2s pause → deletes word → deletes article
  * Purple color for typed text and cursor (rgb(153, 82, 228))
  * Blinking cursor animation (1s step-end infinite)
  * Typing speed: 60ms per character, deletion: 30ms per character

  * White rounded tags (8px border-radius) with dark text
  * Category titles in uppercase gray with letter spacing
  * Smooth purple hover effect (rgb(153, 82, 228)) with white text
- Interactive skill-based filtering system:
  * Multi-select filtering: multiple skills can be active simultaneously
  * AND logic: projects shown only if they match ALL selected skills
  * Visual feedback: non-matching projects get 30% opacity + 100% grayscale filter
  * CSS order property reorders filtered projects (matching: order 0, non-matching: order 1)
  * Active skill tags highlighted in purple background
  * Toggle behavior: click to select/deselect individual skills
  * "Clear Filter" button (compact, auto-width) appears when filters active
  * Smooth 0.5s transitions on all filter effects
  * Uses Set data structure to track active skills

- Typing animation pause uses isPaused flag + clearTimeout for clean state management
- Reach Out gradient animation uses 200% background-size with 4s ease infinite timing
- Contact cascade uses nested setTimeout for sequential highlighting
- Section backgrounds use inline styles (About Me) and <style> blocks for consistency
- Pointer-events management critical for layered interactive elements (particles + text + terminal)
- CSS sibling selector (~) triggers timeline dot animations from content hover
- IntersectionObserver provides reversible scroll animations with cleanup
- Filter chain for logo recolor: brightness(0) → invert(47%) → sepia(85%) → saturate(2274%) → hue-rotate(239deg)

================================================================================

## SESSION 5 - October 3, 2025 (Final Polish)

### GOALS COMPLETED
- [X] Implement global scaling factor for entire website

### KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS

**Global Scaling:**
- Added `font-size: 90%;` to `html` element in `globals.css`
- Reduces all rem-based elements proportionally (fonts, padding, margins, icons)
- Text content and spacing scale down uniformly
- Viewport-based units (vh/vw) remain unchanged for proper section layouts
- Maintains responsive design integrity across all breakpoints

### FILES MODIFIED
```
src/styles/globals.css
```

### TECHNICAL NOTES
- `font-size: 90%` on html element affects all rem calculations site-wide
- Percentage scaling preferred over fixed rem values for proportional adjustments
- vh/vw units intentionally excluded from scaling to preserve viewport-relative layouts
- Section heights and structural spacing remain responsive to viewport size
- All existing rem-based designs automatically scale without individual modifications

### SESSION 5 SUMMARY

**What was accomplished:**
- Implemented global scaling factor reducing overall site size by 10%
- All text, icons, and rem-based spacing now proportionally smaller
- Improved content density while maintaining readability

**Current state:**
- Complete portfolio website with all 6 sections fully populated and styled
- Consistent 90% scaling applied to all rem-based elements
- Viewport-relative layouts (sections, spacing) preserved at original sizes
- All interactive elements and animations functioning correctly at new scale

**Next priorities:**
- Project image integration
- Performance optimization
- Cross-browser testing
- Accessibility improvements
- Mobile responsiveness verification
