# PROJECT TO-DO & SESSION TRACKER

## HOW TO USE THIS FILE

This file tracks progress across development sessions and serves as project memory.

RULES:
1. For each new work session, create a new "SESSION" section with date/time
2. List all goals and steps for that session under the session header
3. Mark steps as [DONE] or [IN PROGRESS] as work progresses
4. At the end of each session, create a "SESSION SUMMARY" with:
   - What was accomplished
   - What remains to be done
   - Any blockers or notes for next session
5. Keep this file updated in real-time - update after completing each step

## SESSION 1 - October 2, 2025

### GOALS
- [ ] Set up project skeleton with Astro + React + Tailwind + TypeScript
- [ ] Create modular, scalable folder structure following industry best practices
- [ ] Establish clean separation of concerns (components, layouts, lib, data, types)
- [ ] Configure path aliases for clean imports
- [ ] Document structure with READMEs in each directory

### STEPS
[DONE] Initialize package.json with core dependencies
[DONE] Configure astro.config.mjs
[DONE] Configure tsconfig.json with path aliases
[DONE] Configure tailwind.config.mjs
[DONE] Create folder structure (components, layouts, lib, data, content, types)
[DONE] Add README.md files to each directory explaining purpose and patterns
[DONE] Create minimal index.astro home page
[DONE] Add .gitkeep files to empty directories
[DONE] Create project README.md with structure overview
[DONE] Create to-do.txt for session tracking

### NOTES
- Structure is minimal and expandable
- No placeholder content or components added
- Ready to build features incrementally

================================================================================

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
- TBD based on project direction
