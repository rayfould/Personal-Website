# PROJECT TO-DO & SESSION TRACKER

## HOW TO USE THIS FILE

This file tracks progress across development sessions and serves as project memory.

RULES:
1. For each new work session, create a new "SESSION" section with date/time
2. List all goals and steps for that session under the session header
3. Mark steps as [DONE] or [IN PROGRESS] as work progresses
4. At the end of each session, create a "SESSION SUMMARY" with:
   - What was accomplished
   - What remains to be done
   - Any blockers or notes for next session
5. Keep this file updated in real-time - update after completing each step

- [ ] Configure path aliases for clean imports
- [ ] Document structure with READMEs in each directory

### STEPS
[DONE] Initialize package.json with core dependencies

[DONE] Create to-do.txt for session tracking

### NOTES
- Structure is minimal and expandable
- No placeholder content or components added
- Ready to build features incrementally
