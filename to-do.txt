# PROJECT TO-DO & SESSION TRACKER

## HOW TO USE THIS FILE

This file tracks progress across development sessions and serves as project memory.

RULES:
1. For each new work session, create a new "SESSION" section with date/time
2. List all goals and steps for that session under the session header
3. Mark steps as [DONE] or [IN PROGRESS] as work progresses
4. At the end of each session, create a "SESSION SUMMARY" with:
   - What was accomplished
   - What remains to be done
   - Any blockers or notes for next session
5. Keep this file updated in real-time - update after completing each step

## SESSION 1 - October 2, 2025

### GOALS COMPLETED
- [X] Set up project skeleton with Astro + React + Tailwind + TypeScript
- [X] Create modular, scalable folder structure following industry best practices
- [X] Configure path aliases for clean imports
- [X] Document structure with READMEs in each directory
- [X] Implement dark theme across the website
- [X] Integrate particles.js library for interactive background
- [X] Create single-page layout with smooth scroll navigation
- [X] Build all main sections (Home, Projects, Timeline, Education, Reach Out)

### KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS

**Project Foundation:**
- Initialized package.json with core dependencies (Astro, React, Tailwind, TypeScript)
- Configured astro.config.mjs, tsconfig.json with path aliases, tailwind.config.mjs
- Created modular folder structure: components, layouts, lib, data, content, types
- Added README files to each directory explaining purpose and patterns
- Created project README with structure overview
- Set up .gitkeep files for empty directories

**Design & Styling:**
- Implemented dark theme (black background, white text) in globals.css
- Added smooth scroll behavior for navigation

**Interactive Background:**
- Integrated particles.js v2.0.0 via CDN (after debugging npm package issues)
- Configured ParticlesBackground component with user's custom config
- Positioned particles only on home section (not fullscreen)

**Page Structure:**
- Created Navigation component with anchor links
- Built section components: HomeSection, ProjectsSection, TimelineSection, EducationSection, ReachOutSection
- Each section is minimum 100vh
- Single-page layout with smooth scroll navigation

### FILES CREATED
```

  components/
    layout/Navigation.astro
    sections/HomeSection.astro, ProjectsSection.astro, TimelineSection.astro, 
             EducationSection.astro, ReachOutSection.astro
    ParticlesBackground.astro
  pages/index.astro
  styles/globals.css
package.json, astro.config.mjs, tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.mjs
README.md, to-do.txt
```

### TECHNICAL NOTES
- Particles.js using CDN instead of npm packages for reliability
- Path aliases configured (@/components, @/layouts, etc.)
- Single-page application with anchor link navigation
- Each section is self-contained component
- Dark theme is global default

### SESSION 1 SUMMARY

**What was accomplished:**
- Complete project skeleton with modular, scalable architecture
- Working dark theme with interactive particles.js background
- Full single-page layout with 5 sections and navigation
- All sections ready for content population
- Clean separation of concerns following industry best practices

**Current state:**
- Project structure is complete and ready for content
- All sections are blank canvases (just headings)
- Navigation works with smooth scrolling
- Particles background active on home section only

**Next priorities:**
- Add content to each section
- Style navigation bar
- Build out individual section layouts and content
- Add interactivity where needed
