# Components

Reusable UI components organized by feature/type.

## Structure
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use Astro components (.astro) for static content
- Use React components (.tsx) when you need interactivity

## Organization patterns
```
/components
  /ui          # Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs, cards)
  /sections    # Page sections (hero, about, etc)
  /islands     # Interactive React components
  /layout      # Layout-specific components (header, footer, nav)
```
